            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-foreground/90 ml-4">
              <li><strong>Services</strong> – Any travel‐related consulting, visa assistance, bookings, or other products offered by OGT.</li>
              <li><strong>Travel Package</strong> – A bundled itinerary sold by OGT that may include flights, accommodations, transfers, tours, cruises, insurance, or other add‑ons.</li>
              <li><strong>Visa Assistance Fee</strong> – The professional fee charged by OGT for advising on, compiling, and/or submitting a visa application on the Client's behalf.</li>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-4">3. Scope of Services</h2>
            <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
              OGT acts as an independent travel advisor and intermediary between Clients and Suppliers. We arrange travel products, provide visa guidance, and facilitate related services as outlined in your invoice, proposal, or confirmation email. OGT does not own or control the Suppliers and is not liable for their acts or omissions.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section className="mb-8">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-4">4. Booking & Payment</h2>
            <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>4.1 Quotes & Availability</strong> – All quotes are subject to availability and may change until payment is received and confirmations are issued.</p>
            <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>4.2 Deposit & Final Payment</strong> – A non‑refundable deposit (percentage or fixed amount indicated in your quote) is due at the time of booking. Final payment deadlines vary by Supplier and will be stated on your invoice. Failure to remit payment by the deadline may result in automatic cancellation and loss of deposit.</p>
            <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>4.3 Payment Methods</strong> – We accept major credit/debit cards, ACH, or other methods shown at checkout. Processing fees may apply.</p>
            <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed"><strong>4.4 Currency & Pricing</strong> – All prices are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Currency fluctuations, tax increases, fuel surcharges, or Supplier‑imposed price adjustments may affect the final balance.</p>
          </section>

          <section className="mb-8">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-4">5. Visa Assistance Services</h2>
            <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>5.1 No Guarantee of Visa Approval</strong> – OGT provides administrative support and guidance only. Visa issuance is the sole prerogative of the destination's consular authority. OGT cannot guarantee approval, processing time, or outcome.</p>
            <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>5.2 Waiver of Visa Assistance Fee</strong> – The Visa Assistance Fee is automatically waived when the Client purchases one Travel Package or any two (2) additional billable OGT services (e.g., flights + hotel, cruise + insurance) in the same transaction.</p>
            <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>5.3 Refund of Visa Assistance Fee</strong> – A 100% refund of the Visa Assistance Fee will be issued only if:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-foreground/90 ml-8 mb-4">
              <li>(a) the visa application is denied and</li>
              <li>(b) the official decision letter explicitly cites missing or incomplete documents that were listed on OGT's provided checklist.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed mb-4">Refund requests must be submitted in writing within 30 calendar days of the denial decision, accompanied by the official refusal letter and checklist. No other grounds (e.g., personal circumstances, interview issues, consular discretion) qualify for a refund.</p>
            <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed"><strong>5.4 Client Responsibilities</strong> – You must provide truthful, complete information and original documents by the deadlines we specify. Failure to do so may invalidate any refund eligibility.</p>
          </section>

          <section className="mb-8">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-4">6. Travel Packages & Other Services</h2>
            <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>6.1 Supplier Contracts</strong> – Your participation in flights, cruises, tours, hotels, or insurance is subject to each Supplier's own terms (including fare rules, baggage limits, cancellation penalties, and conditions of carriage). By booking, you agree to those terms.</p>
            <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>6.2 Changes by Suppliers</strong> – Airlines and other Suppliers may adjust schedules, routes, ship deployments, or accommodations. Where possible, OGT will help secure comparable alternatives; however, such changes are outside OGT's control.</p>
            <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed"><strong>6.3 Unused Components</strong> – No refunds are issued for unused package components once travel has commenced.</p>
          </section>

          <section className="mb-8">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-4">7. Cancellations, Changes & Refunds</h2>
            <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>7.1 Client‑Initiated</strong> – Cancellation or change fees vary by Supplier and fare class. OGT's Service Fee and any non‑refundable deposits are forfeited upon cancellation. Written notice is required.</p>
            <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>7.2 OGT/Supplier‑Initiated</strong> – If a Supplier cancels a service (e.g., cruise sailing), we will follow the Supplier's refund or credit policy. OGT is not responsible for incidental costs (e.g., visa fees, vaccinations, flights not booked through OGT).</p>
            <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed"><strong>7.3 Chargebacks</strong> – Initiating a chargeback without first giving OGT a reasonable opportunity to resolve your complaint violates these Terms and may incur additional collection or legal fees.</p>

          <section className="mb-8">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-4">8. Travel Insurance</h2>
            <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
              OGT strongly recommends purchasing comprehensive travel insurance covering trip cancellation, medical expenses, evacuation, COVID‑19 disruptions, and supplier default. Declining insurance may result in significant financial loss for which you accept sole responsibility.

            <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
              You are responsible for meeting all health (e.g., vaccinations), passport validity, and entry requirements for each destination and transit point. Check official government resources prior to departure. OGT is not liable for denied boarding or entry due to non‑compliance.

            <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
              OGT is relieved of performance obligations when an extraordinary event beyond its control prevents or delays fulfillment of Services. Deposits and payments may be converted to future travel credit subject to Supplier terms.

            <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
              These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Texas, USA, without regard to conflicts of law principles.
